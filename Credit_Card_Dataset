📂 Dataset Overview

Name: Credit Card Fraud Detection Dataset

Source: Kaggle – Credit Card Fraud Detection

Size: 284,807 transactions

Fraud Cases: 492 (≈0.172%) → highly imbalanced dataset

📑 Dataset Content

The dataset contains transactions made by European cardholders in September 2013.

Features:

Time: Number of seconds elapsed between the transaction and the first transaction in the dataset.

V1–V28: Numerical features obtained by PCA (Principal Component Analysis) to protect confidentiality of sensitive information.

Amount: Transaction amount (used for scaling in ML models).

Class: Target variable (0 = Non-Fraud, 1 = Fraud).

⚖️ Class Distribution

Non-Fraud (0): 284,315

Fraud (1): 492

This imbalance makes fraud detection a challenging problem, requiring special handling techniques (e.g., under-sampling, over-sampling, or anomaly detection).

🧾 Usage in Project

Features Time and Amount were scaled using StandardScaler.

PCA-transformed features (V1–V28) used directly.

Class column is the target variable for classification models.

Imbalance handled using Random Under-Sampling before training models.
